# README.md for Resume Screening with Python

# Resume Screening with Machine Learning (Python Project)

Automatically classify resumes into job roles using machine learning, text processing, and visualization.

## 🔍 Project Objective
To build a machine learning model that can analyze resumes and predict the most relevant job category using text data.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn
- Text cleaning and preprocessing using NLP
- Visualizing data with Seaborn and WordCloud
- TF-IDF Vectorization for text
- Label Encoding for categorical data
- Training OneVsRestClassifier with KNeighborsClassifier
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy and classification report

## 📁 Dataset
`UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv` — contains resumes and their corresponding job categories.

You can download the dataset from [here]

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Upload the dataset file `UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv` in Google Colab.
2. Paste the provided notebook code into a new Colab notebook.
3. Run the code step-by-step. It will:
   - Load and clean data
   - Visualize category distributions
   - Train and evaluate the classifier

## ✅ Results
- **Train Accuracy:** ~99%
- **Test Accuracy:** ~99%
- Excellent classification report with precision and recall close to 1.0 for all categories

## 📊 Output Visuals
- Bar chart of resume categories
- WordCloud of most common resume terms

## 📘 Skills Demonstrated
- Data Preprocessing
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning Classification
- Model Evaluation

## 💼 Ideal For
- HR Tech startups
- Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
